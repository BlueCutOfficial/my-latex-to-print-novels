% pagestyle defines the global look of all pages. When using the document class "book", it default to something that actually doesn't fit novels so much.

% Default "book" margins let a lot of space at page top and bottom. Also, they dont let the same side margins on even and odd pages because they care about the binding. This is nice, but maybe somehow overkill as printers often advice to let 2cm on each side.
% I use the package geometry to configure the margins I want.
% It can be done without geometry, but in this case you'll have to use commands to add or remove a size from the default margin. And as they are not the same on left and right and it's hard to make sure what are the initial values, I found the use of geometry safer.
